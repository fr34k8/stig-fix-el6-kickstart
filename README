ABOUT
=====

Modifies a RHEL 6.4+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured with the DISA STIG for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects
into a single installer:

   - stig-fix-1.7.8.el6.noarch.rpm (Hardening scripts from DISA STIG RPM scripts)

        https://github.com/RedHatGov/stig-fix-el6

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying graphical classification banner)

        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark for the system after installation

        https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide

   - DOD Firefox Plugin

CONTENT
=======

createiso.sh - installation script to modify RHEL 6.4+ ISO image
/config - Kickstarts, Python, and RPMs needed to modify image.
	isolinux/
		grub.conf - Menu Configuration for Kickstart
		isolinux.cfg - Menu Configuration for Kickstart
	stig-fix/
		stig-fix.cfg

			Kickstart Configuration (Calls menu.py in %pre)

		menu.py

			Python Script that presents a graphical menu to modify the
			kickstart. Contains the "Profiles" for configuring the
			system partitioning and packages.

		classification-banner.py

			Graphical Classification Banner (for GNOME Desktops User/
			Developer Workstation Profiles)

		dod_firefox_config.tar.gz

			DOD Firefox Plugin and DOD Root CA Certificates for NIPR (SPIR
			CAs would need to be added and repackaged via taring up the
			.mozzilla directory - placed in /etc/skel for all users.

		stig-fix-1.7.8-el6.noarch.rpm

			RPM Created from my fork of Aqueduct here:

				https://github.com/RedHatGov/stig-fix-el6

			The hardening is run at the last part of the kickstart script to
			lockdown the system, this could theoretically be replaced by the
			SCAP Security Guide Scripts below at a later date.

		scap-security-guide-0.1-17.el6.noarch.rpm

			WILL BE REMOVED WITH RHEL 6.6 (SSG will be part of baseline)

			Currently I use ths SSG Scripts to take a benchmark to save in
			root after installation.
